My approach for creating the Upvote/Downvote system for my social media system would be the following:

1. create a test to check if someone has upvoted/downvoted a post
2. create a test to ensure that a person gets one vote per post.  
3. create a test to check that an upvote increases the total by 1
4. create a test to check that a downvote decreases the total by 1
5. implement finished product.
